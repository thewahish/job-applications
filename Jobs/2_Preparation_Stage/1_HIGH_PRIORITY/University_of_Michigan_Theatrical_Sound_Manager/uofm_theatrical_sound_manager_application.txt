Hiring Committee
University of Michigan
School of Music, Theatre & Dance

Dear Hiring Committee,

For more than twenty years I've worked at the intersection of sound, media, and technology. I've managed theatrical and broadcast sound systems, trained students and staff, and kept large-scale productions running under pressure. The Theatrical Sound Manager and Mentor Instructor role at the University of Michigan matches the combination of technical skill and mentorship I've built throughout my career.

At Spacetoon/Tiger Media, I managed international technology teams across Damascus, Dubai, and Kuala Lumpur, running broadcast and theatrical sound operations and supporting distance-learning platforms. I later co-founded Radio Al-Kul, which broadcast from a conflict zone to half a million daily listeners, and created Karazah Channel on YouTube, now at more than 715,000 subscribers and 300 million views. Alongside this, I founded Audio Blast Academy, developing my own curriculum to teach sound production in Arabic, which gave me direct experience as a mentor and instructor.

Today, as IT Director & Systems Architect at Synergy Senior Management, I oversee infrastructure across 18+ facilities, supervise staff, and maintain 99.8% uptime. I combine this technical management with my background in theatrical and media sound, giving me a unique ability to support University Productions across nine fully mounted shows each season while guiding students in both shop and performance settings.

I have been recognized internationally, receiving the Mohammed Bin Rashid Arabic Language Award from the Governor of Dubai, being profiled by the Washington Post, and endorsed by senior leaders at Oracle and Workiom. These experiences reflect not only technical ability but also credibility and resilience—qualities I would bring to the University of Michigan.

I would be proud to contribute to the School of Music, Theatre & Dance's mission by leading sound operations, mentoring students, and supporting productions with professionalism and creativity. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Obai (O.B.) Sukar
