# Analysis Stage Job Organization

## 📁 New Hierarchical Structure

The Analysis Stage (`Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/`) now uses a **category-based organization** for better job management:

```
Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/
├── IT_Technology/          # IT, Director, Enterprise Architect, etc.
├── Audio_Sound/           # Sound Designer, Audio Engineer, etc.
├── Creative_Media/        # Creative Producer, Studio Director, etc.
├── analysis.md           # System files remain at root level
├── MASTER_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md
├── obai_sukar_logo.png
├── README.md
└── UPDATED_MASTER_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md
```

## 🔧 Workflow Integration

### For New Job Assessments:
1. **Determine job category** based on role type
2. **Create folder in appropriate category**:
   - `Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/IT_Technology/[Company_Role]/`
   - `Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/Audio_Sound/[Company_Role]/`
   - `Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/Creative_Media/[Company_Role]/`

### Examples:
```bash
# IT Position
Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/IT_Technology/Microsoft_Senior_IT_Director/

# Audio Position  
Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/Audio_Sound/Netflix_Sound_Designer/

# Creative Position
Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/Creative_Media/Adobe_Creative_Director/
```

## 🛠️ Duplicate Detection Compatibility

The duplicate detection script (`check_duplicates.sh`) has been **updated to handle nested structure**:

- ✅ **Scans category folders automatically**
- ✅ **Maintains priority hierarchy** (Applied > Preparation > Analysis)
- ✅ **Shows organized output** with category labels
- ✅ **Handles automatic cleanup** for nested paths

### Sample Output:
```
Checking Analysis (Priority: 2):
  📁 IT_Technology category:
    ✅ Naviant_Director_IT
    ✅ Dubai_IT_Manager
  📁 Audio_Sound category:
    ✅ Lightspeed_Studios_Sound_Designer
    ✅ Valve_Software_Sound_Designer
```
