Subject: Question about the Audio-AI Lead role at Meta (from a fellow gamer)

Hi Faisal,

Hope you're having a great week.

I'm writing to you as a long-time gamer and audio professional. I saw the Creative Audio-AI Voice and Audio Lead role at Meta, and it immediately clicked with my experience. I've spent my career designing sound, from my work on the Student Academy Award-winning film "Cloud Kumo" to currently leading a governmental VR audio project.

As a gamer and content creator, you understand how crucial immersive audio is to the experience. I believe the next frontier is generative AI audio that can create dynamic, responsive soundscapes in real-time.

I've just submitted my application. If you have a moment, I'd love to get your perspective on how Meta is approaching audio for its immersive experiences and games. Any insight from your point of view would be fantastic.

Thanks,
Obai Sukar
