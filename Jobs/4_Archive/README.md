### Core Selling Points:
1. **Game Audio Technical Expertise:** Wwise, FMOD middleware, game engine implementation
2. **Creature Sound Design:** 301M+ views on character-driven content (Karazah)
3. **Fantasy & Whimsical Audio:** Student Academy Award winner (Cloud Kumo), animation experience
4. **Remote Collaboration:** 9-country team leadership across multiple time zones
5. **Player Experience Understanding:** Lifelong gamer who creates game audio
6. **Technical Mastery:** Pro Tools/Nuendo expert, performance optimization

### Strategic Testimonial:
**Michael Shagoury (SVP):** "When it comes to audio, Obai is a perfectionist and his creativity is unmatched."
