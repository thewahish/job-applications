## 🔧 Updated Workflow Rules

   - **IT_Technology:** Director IT, Enterprise Architect, IT Manager, Technical Support, IT Security
   - **Audio_Sound:** Sound Designer, Audio Engineer, Music Producer, Audio Technician
   - **Creative_Media:** Creative Producer, Studio Director, Media Production

2. **Create in appropriate category:**
   ```bash
   Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/IT_Technology/[Company_Role]/
   Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/Audio_Sound/[Company_Role]/
   Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/Creative_Media/[Company_Role]/
   ```

### **For Stage Progression:**
- **Analysis → Preparation:** Move entire folder to same category in Preparation
- **Preparation → Applied:** Move entire folder to same category in Applied  
- **Applied → Archive:** Move entire folder to same category in Archive
- **Any → Cancelled:** Move entire folder to same category in Cancelled

### **For Duplicate Prevention:**
