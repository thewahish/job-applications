        <div class="greeting">
            Dear Hiring Committee,
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Harlem Children's Zone has redefined what it means to support children and families. Few organizations carry a mission so bold — to break cycles of poverty through education and opportunity. My career has been built at that same intersection of technology, media, and childhood development, and I believe my experience aligns directly with your vision.</p>

            <div class="highlight-section">
                <h3>Enterprise IT Leadership & Child-Focused Technology Innovation</h3>
                <p>I have led IT at scale, securing networks and cloud systems across 18+ healthcare facilities while keeping operations resilient and compliant. I have also built technology for children: as Founder of Karazah Channel, I directed teams across nine countries, coordinating multiple time zones to deliver Arabic educational media that reached 715K+ subscribers and 301M+ views, earning the Mohammed Bin Rashid Arabic Language Award.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Earlier at Spacetoon, I managed audio technology for children's series loved by millions, ensuring quality and safety across studios in Syria and Malaysia. This combination — enterprise IT leadership and hands-on experience in global children's education platforms — gives me a unique lens for leading HCZ's IT department.</p>

            <p>I understand both the complexity of secure, high-availability systems and the responsibility of building tools that serve young learners and their communities.</p>

            <div class="testimonial-section">
                <p><strong>"I have worked with Obai on establishing a leading Radio channel in the region. Obai has not only brought his energy, integrity, and exquisite taste to the radio, he also gave it its soul. He is by far one of the best professionals I had the pleasure to partner with."</strong></p>

            <p>I would value the chance to speak with you about how my background in infrastructure, team leadership, and child-focused technology can contribute to Harlem Children's Zone's mission.</p>
