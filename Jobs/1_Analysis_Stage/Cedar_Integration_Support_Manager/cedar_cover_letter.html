        <p><strong>To:</strong> Cedar Hiring Committee<br>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Dear Cedar Hiring Committee,</p>
        
        <p>Cedar's mission to make healthcare more affordable and accessible resonates strongly with my career. For two decades, I've built IT systems and integration frameworks for healthcare, education, and nonprofit organizations. I understand both the technical and human side of escalations — where system failures impact real lives.</p>
        
        <p>At Synergy Senior Management, I managed IT for 18+ facilities, deploying SaaS platforms (M365, Intune, Entra ID) with HIPAA compliance and near-perfect uptime. I transformed our incident process by rolling out RMM/PSA with automation, cutting response times by ~75%. In consulting, I supported healthcare SaaS integrations and incident response playbooks across diverse environments, coordinating root cause analysis between engineering and business stakeholders.</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>Key Qualifications for Cedar's Integration Support Engineering Role:</h4>
            <div class="achievements-list">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SaaS Integration Leadership:</strong> 20+ years managing B2B healthcare technology, Microsoft 365, Azure AD/Entra ID, and multi-stack application environments</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Response Excellence:</strong> Reduced response times by 75% through RMM/PSA automation and cross-functional escalation playbooks</li>
                    <li><strong>Healthcare Technology Expertise:</strong> HIPAA-compliant operations across 18+ facilities with zero security incidents and perfect compliance record</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Functional Communication:</strong> Proven bridge between technical engineering teams and commercial stakeholders in high-pressure environments</li>
                    <li><strong>Crisis-Tested Leadership:</strong> Maintained critical systems supporting 500K+ daily users under extreme conditions, featured in NPR and Washington Post</li>
                    <li><strong>Global Team Coordination:</strong> Successfully managed international teams across 9 countries and multiple time zones with complex technical deliverables</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>My experience extends beyond enterprise IT into mission-driven media. As founder of Karazah Channel, I directed global teams in 9 countries to build one of the largest Arabic early education platforms (715K+ subscribers, 301M+ views). In every role, I've balanced technical depth with cross-functional leadership, ensuring teams deliver clarity, speed, and resilience under pressure.</p>
        
        <p>What distinguishes my candidacy is my unique combination of healthcare technology expertise and crisis-tested reliability. Managing IT operations for Radio Al-Kul under challenging conditions taught me that in healthcare technology, there are no second chances—systems must work flawlessly because real lives depend on them. This experience, recognized by major media outlets, demonstrates my ability to maintain critical infrastructure when stakes are highest.</p>
        
        <p>I see a direct fit between my background and Cedar's need for a leader who can evolve its Integration Support Engineering into a high-impact Escalations function. I bring the ability to triage complex incidents, drive cross-stack communication, and turn chronic issues into long-term improvements. My experience with healthcare SaaS integrations, HIPAA compliance, and incident management across distributed teams positions me to excel in Cedar's mission-critical environment.</p>
        
        <p>I would welcome the chance to discuss how my expertise in SaaS integration, incident management, and healthcare IT can advance Cedar's mission to transform healthcare payments and improve patient access to care.</p>
