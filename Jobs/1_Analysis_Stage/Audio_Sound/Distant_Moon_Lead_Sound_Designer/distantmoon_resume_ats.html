        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            A creative and meticulous Lead Sound Designer with over 25 years of experience in post-production for film, TV, and narrative content. As the credited Audio Director for the animated feature "The Eternal Parade," I oversaw the entire sonic landscape, from sound design and foley to mixing orchestral scores and dialogue. My expertise in Pro Tools, Steinberg Nuendo, and iZotope RX, combined with a history of managing audio departments and architecting workflows, makes me ideally suited to deliver world-class audio while developing the robust best practices Distant Moon requires.
