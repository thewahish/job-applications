Subject: Strategic question regarding the Creative Audio-AI Lead position

Hi Eslam,

Hope you are well.

I'm reaching out to you because of your deep expertise in the business and investment side of technology at Meta. I recently applied for the Creative Audio-AI Voice and Audio Lead position, a role that I feel is a culmination of my 25 years in technical and creative leadership.

My career has been about scaling audio operations, from managing international dubbing departments for Spacetoon to architecting IT infrastructure for over 18 facilities. Now, I'm leading a governmental VR audio project and see a massive opportunity for AI to create new revenue streams and business models through sound.

Given your background, I was hoping to get your high-level perspective on the strategic importance of this AI audio role at Meta. Any insight into how this team's work might shape future products and investments would be invaluable.

Best regards,
Obai Sukar
