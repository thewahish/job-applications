Subject: Quick question about the Creative Audio-AI Lead role at Meta

Hi Tasnim,

Hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out because I saw the Creative Audio-AI Voice and Audio Lead position open at Meta, and it aligns perfectly with my 25-year journey in audio and technical leadership. Given your expertise in branding and digital marketing, I thought you'd have a unique perspective on this.

My background spans from managing Spacetoon's dubbing department and directing voice talent to now leading a governmental VR audio project. I believe the future of brand identity lies in unique sonic experiences, especially with AI, and it seems Meta is at the forefront of that.

I've just applied, but I was wondering if you had any insights into the creative culture or the role audio plays in Meta's broader brand strategy. Any thoughts you might have would be incredibly helpful.

Thanks for your time,
Obai Sukar
