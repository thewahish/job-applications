            <p>Dear Adyen Hiring Manager,</p>
            
            <p>Technology is my DNA. I assembled my first computer in 8th grade and was the kid running BASIC programming on MS-DOS with floppy disks. Technology has been my passion and ultimate joy since childhood—I've never stopped progressing with IT as my greatest source of fun and discovery.</p>
            
            <p>This passion drove me to build and scale technical support organizations in complex environments for more than two decades. I am writing to express my strong interest in the <span class="position-title">Head of Technical Support, Americas</span> position at <span class="company-name">Adyen</span>. Your mission to enable businesses and financial institutions to achieve their ambitions resonates deeply with my experience building technical support infrastructure that empowers global operations.</p>
            
            <p>My experience leading enterprise technical support operations across multiple regions positions me perfectly for this role:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Regional Technical Support Leadership:</strong> Currently serving as IT Director at Synergy Senior Management, I lead technical support operations across 18+ facilities spanning the Americas region, managing 50+ technical staff and contractors while achieving 99.8% uptime with zero security incidents.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Large-Scale Team Management:</strong> I have successfully managed technical support teams of 50-70+ staff across multiple time zones, implementing coaching programs, developing growth paths, and maintaining high performance standards in mission-critical environments.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Enterprise Systems Expertise:</strong> I have implemented Salesforce Service Cloud, advanced ticketing systems, and multi-tier escalation frameworks with SLA monitoring across multiple organizations, ensuring efficient incident response and customer satisfaction tracking.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Financial Technology Alignment:</strong> My healthcare IT experience includes managing secure financial transactions, PCI compliance frameworks, and payment processing protocols—directly relevant to Adyen's financial technology platform requirements.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Crisis-Tested Operations:</strong> Through managing Radio Al-Kul's technical infrastructure serving 500K daily users under extreme conditions, I've proven my ability to build resilient support infrastructure and maintain service delivery during challenging circumstances.</p>
            
            <p>I understand both the complexity of financial technology platforms and the strategic importance of technical support as a driver of customer success and business growth. With experience managing 24/7 operations, implementing incident response protocols, and building scalable support processes, I'm prepared to drive exceptional outcomes for Adyen's expansion across North and Latin American markets.</p>
            
            <p>I'm recognized by Sinan Hatahet, PhD—Co-Founder of Workiom CRM—as "by far one of the best professionals I had the pleasure to partner with." This leadership credibility, combined with Washington Post recognition and the Governor of Dubai Award, demonstrates the proven track record of excellence I bring to Adyen's technical support leadership.</p>
            
            <p>I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my global support leadership to Adyen, building strategies, empowering teams, and ensuring a world-class customer experience across the Americas. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my proven expertise in regional operations, enterprise systems, and large-scale team leadership can drive exceptional outcomes for Adyen's growing customer base.</p>

                <p>Sincerely,<br>
