2. Use ONLY verified data from knowledge base
3. **NEVER fabricate URLs, dates, contact info, or any data**
4. When information is missing ‚Üí ASK, don't assume

## CRITICAL DATA CORRECTIONS (LOCKED)
### Personal Brand Identity (CORRECTED UNDERSTANDING)
- **Syrian-American public figure** (not just Syrian)
- **Obai Sukar IS the personal brand** - NOT a consultant for personal brands
- **"Obai Sukar (Personal Brand) Consulting"** - The name itself is the brand
- **Built the Obai Sukar name** as a personal brand for:
  - Media innovation
  - Advocacy and activism
  - Social justice
  - Consulting services
- **NEVER say**: "personal brand consultant" (implies helping others with branding)
- **DO say**: "Built the Obai Sukar name as a recognized personal brand"

### Correct Timeline (MANDATORY)
- **SS Media Productions**: Founded 2010 (still active - use "2010‚ÄìPresent")
- **Karazah Channel**: Launched July 2016 (part of SS Media)
- **Radio Al-Kul**: 2012‚Äì2016
- **Mohammed Bin Rashid Award**: 2019
- **301M+ views**: Belongs to Karazah Channel, NOT personal brand

### Live Sound Engineering (CORRECTED)
- **NO SUCH THING as "Mohamed Tarek Productions"** - NEVER use this
- **Position**: Live Sound Engineer (FOH) - Independent/Freelance
- **Period**: 2018‚ÄìPresent (ongoing, no end date)
- **Artists**: Mohamed Tarek (1.2M followers), Mostafa Atef (1.5M followers - currently touring)
- **Bands**: Itar Shameh, Kulna Sawa
- **NEVER fabricate**: Arena capacities, production company names
- **Keep separate**: Live audio is different from broadcast audio

## CORE RULES
- **No Data Fabrication**: Never make up URLs, dates, specifications, or contact details
- **Knowledge Base First**: All resume/project data comes from verified master file
- **Ask When Uncertain**: If data isn't in knowledge base, ask user directly
- **Consistency**: Use established naming, URLs, and formatting from master file
- **Timeline Accuracy**: CRITICAL - Maintain chronological accuracy to preserve credibility

## TIMELINE ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS
**NEVER use phrases that distort career chronology:**
- ‚ùå "I started in a conflict-zone" - Falsely implies career began there (2012 was mid-career)
- ‚ùå Any phrasing suggesting conflict zone work was career beginning

**ALWAYS use timeline-accurate phrasing:**
- ‚úÖ "After building my IT and media career, I found myself in a conflict-zone..." 
- ‚úÖ Shows Radio Al-Kul (2012) as mid-career challenge, not career start (2000)
- ‚úÖ Preserves credibility by maintaining accurate chronological sequence

## MANDATORY BRANDING REQUIREMENTS
**CRITICAL: Every job application MUST use company's official branding**

### TESTIMONIAL FORMATTING RULE (PERMANENT)
**For Premium Cover Letters:**
- **Bold the testimonial quote** and add asterisk (*): `<strong>"quote content"*</strong>`
- **Reference at bottom**: `*Additional verified testimonials can be viewed directly on my LinkedIn profile: linkedin.com/in/obaisukar`
- **Example**: "I'm recognized by [Name] as <strong>"by far one of the best professionals I had the pleasure to partner with."*</strong>"
- **ALWAYS use this format in premium cover letters**

### PDF OPTIMIZATION RULE (PERMANENT)
**For ATS-Friendly HTML Files (Combined & Resume-Only):**
- **Container padding**: 0.3in-0.4in top/bottom, 0.5in-0.6in left/right
- **Print media queries**: Reduce all margins/padding by 30-50% for PDF conversion
- **Font sizes**: 10-11pt body, smaller headers (16-20pt names, 12-14pt section titles)
- **Spacing**: Minimal margins between elements (3-8px typical)
- **Target**: 1-2 pages maximum for combined cover+resume
- **NEVER apply to Premium Cover Letters** - only ATS-friendly files

### Logo Implementation Protocol:
1. **Personal Logo**: ALWAYS copy `D:\Applications\Jobs\obai_sukar_logo.png` to each job folder and use local copy
2. **Company Logo**: Look for company logo in job application folder first
3. **Check for PNG files**: `company_logo.png`, `logo.png`, or similar in folder  
4. **If no logo found**: ASK user to provide logo - "Please provide company logo as PNG file"
5. **Dual Logo Layout**: Personal logo prominent left (larger), company logo respectful right (smaller)
6. **Auto-detect and implement**: If logo file exists, automatically integrate into HTML

### COVER LETTER DESIGN STANDARD (ObserveAI Formula) - LOCKED TEMPLATE
**MANDATORY: Use exact ObserveAI template structure for ALL premium cover letters**

**‚úÖ Cover-Only Files (Visual Design) - PERMANENTLY LOCKED STANDARD:**
- **EXACT Template**: Use D:\Applications\Jobs\3_Applied\ObserveAI_Senior_Implementation_Manager\observeai_cover_only.html structure
- **Header layout** - "COVER LETTER" label (top left where personal logo was) + company logo (right) 
- **NO personal logo in header** - Replace with "COVER LETTER" text label only
- **Gradient name treatment** - Professional visual impact using company colors
- **Company focus section** - Dedicated research/alignment box highlighting company details
- **Sectioned achievements** - List format with strategic spacing and company-relevant accomplishments
- **Dark value proposition section** - Company-branded highlight section emphasizing mutual benefit
- **Brand footer** - Personal logo + website reference at bottom only
- **Typography**: IBM Plex fonts (Google Fonts) for professional elevation
- **Color scheme**: Extract and apply company colors throughout design (borders, gradients, accents)
- **Print optimized**: Minimal spacing, print-ready for PDF conversion
- **Structure**: Follow observeai_cover_only.html exactly but replace personal logo with "COVER LETTER" label

**‚úÖ ATS-Friendly Files (Text Only - CRITICAL RULE):**
- **NO LOGOS** - Text only for ATS parsing
- **NO IMAGES** - Will break ATS scanning
- **NO GRAPHICS** - Pure text formatting
- **Standard fonts** - System fonts only (Arial, Times New Roman, etc.)
- **Simple styling** - Basic CSS, no complex layouts
- **Text-based headers** - Company name in text, not logo

### Color Matching Requirements:
1. **Extract company colors** from logo or company website
2. **Replace default blue (#2c5aa0)** with company's primary color
3. **Apply consistently** across all borders, highlights, and accent elements
4. **Maintain readability**: Ensure text contrast meets accessibility standards

### Implementation Process:
- **Step 1**: Check folder for logo files using Glob tool
- **Step 2**: If found, integrate into HTML with proper styling
- **Step 3**: If not found, ask user: "I need the company logo as a PNG file to match their branding"
- **Step 4**: Extract colors and apply throughout application materials

**NEVER skip branding** - Professional applications must reflect company visual identity

## JOB ROLE EXCLUSION LIST
**NEVER apply to or analyze these types of positions:**

### Gambling/Casino/Betting Roles:
- Slot machine audio/sound design
- Casino gaming equipment development
- Lottery system development
- Sports betting platform roles
- Casino/gambling software development
- Any position involving gambling mechanics, casino operations, or betting systems

### Key Indicators to Watch For:
- Job descriptions mentioning: slots, casino, gambling, betting, lottery, gaming machines
- Company divisions focused on casino/gambling (even if parent company does other work)
- Roles specifically for gambling platforms or casino operations

### Reasoning:
Personal values conflict with gambling industry participation.

### Note: 
Regular video game development (non-gambling) is acceptable, even at companies that have gambling divisions.

## CRITICAL SYNC PROTOCOL (CORE MEMORY - PERMANENT)
**MANDATORY: NEVER miss sync discrepancies - This caused user trust failure**

### BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC REQUIREMENTS:
**CRITICAL: Sync must work BOTH ways with newest versions always**

1. **FETCH FIRST**: Always check for remote changes before local assessment
2. **PULL LATEST**: Get newest remote commits before comparing
3. **COMPARE BOTH DIRECTIONS**:
   - Remote‚ÜíLocal: What's missing locally from GitHub
   - Local‚ÜíRemote: What local changes need to be pushed
4. **NEWEST VERSION WINS**: Always ensure latest changes from both sides are preserved
5. **NEVER lose work**: Commit local changes before pulling if needed

### MANDATORY BIDIRECTIONAL SYNC SEQUENCE:
```bash
# 1. FETCH & CHECK REMOTE STATUS
git fetch origin
git status
git log origin/master --oneline -5
git log HEAD --oneline -5

# 2. CHECK FOR REMOTE CHANGES
git diff HEAD origin/master --name-only

# 3. IF REMOTE IS AHEAD: Pull first, then verify
git pull origin master

# 4. CHECK FOR LOCAL CHANGES TO PUSH
git status
git diff --name-only

# 5. VERIFY COMPLETE SYNC
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD | wc -l
find "D:\Applications" -type f -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/.claude/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | wc -l

# 6. COMPARE STRUCTURES
git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD > /tmp/git_files.txt
find "D:\Applications" -type f -not -path "*/.git/*" -not -path "*/.claude/*" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -printf '%P\n' | sort > /tmp/local_files.txt
diff /tmp/git_files.txt /tmp/local_files.txt

# 7. IF LOCAL CHANGES EXIST: Add, commit, push
git add -A
git commit -m "Sync local changes with remote"
git push origin master
```

### TRUST PROTOCOL:
- **NEVER assume sync is correct** without verification
- **ALWAYS investigate when user questions sync**
- **ADMIT when wrong** and correct immediately
- **Be thorough, not fast** - accuracy over speed
- **BIDIRECTIONAL ALWAYS** - Check both local‚Üíremote and remote‚Üílocal
- **NEWEST VERSION WINS** - Preserve latest changes from both sides

**This bidirectional protocol is now PERMANENT core memory for this project.**

## SESSION CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
Confirm you've read the master knowledge base before starting any resume/job application work.
