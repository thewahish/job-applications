# Claude Code Session Instructions for Obai

## MANDATORY STARTUP ROUTINE
1. **ALWAYS** read `MD\ULTIMATE_RESUME_HELPER_MASTER_v2.md` at start of each session
2. Use ONLY verified data from knowledge base
3. **NEVER fabricate URLs, dates, contact info, or any data**
4. When information is missing ‚Üí ASK, don't assume

## CORE RULES
- **No Data Fabrication**: Never make up URLs, dates, specifications, or contact details
- **Knowledge Base First**: All resume/project data comes from verified master file
- **Ask When Uncertain**: If data isn't in knowledge base, ask user directly
- **Consistency**: Use established naming, URLs, and formatting from master file

## WRITING STYLE - AUTHENTIC OBAI VOICE
**CRITICAL: Cover letters must sound like Obai, not AI-generated content**

### ‚úÖ Obai's Authentic Style:
- **Story-driven and emotional** - Real experiences with human impact
- **Direct, confident statements** - "You need someone who gets it"  
- **Personal vulnerability as strength** - Authentic background sharing
- **Bold declarations** - "This is a prodigy you're talking about"
- **Conversational flow** - Natural rhythm, not corporate structure
- **Cultural bridges** - Personal background as differentiator
- **Results with heart** - Numbers tied to human stories

### ‚ùå Avoid AI Patterns:
- "It is not just X, it is Y" constructions
- Overly structured corporate transitions  
- Buzzword stacking without story
- Formulaic "Dear [Company]" + bullet points + "Sincerely"
- Generic "I am excited to apply" openings

### üìú Award References:
- **US Audience:** "Governor of Dubai Award" (more recognizable)
- **Official Links:** Keep "Mohammed Bin Rashid Arabic Language Award" in verified URLs

## JOB APPLICATION WORKFLOW
**CRITICAL: Follow this exact process for job applications:**

### Stage 1: PREPARATION (Jobs/1_Analysis_Stage/[Company]/)
1. Analyze job posting and create compatibility analysis
2. Research company for brand colors and visual identity

### Stage 2: MATERIAL CREATION (Jobs/1_Preparation_Stage/[Company]/)
3. Create company-specific materials:
   - Targeted resume with role-specific focus
   - Custom cover letter with company research
   - Combined HTML file (cover letter + resume)
   - Company-branded styling (colors, visual identity)
   - PDF versions ready for submission
4. **WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** - Do NOT move to applied until user confirms

### Stage 3: APPLICATION (Jobs/2_Applied/[Company]/)
5. **ONLY after user explicitly says "applied"** - move materials to applied folder
6. User must confirm they submitted the application before folder transition

**NEVER assume application status - always ask for explicit confirmation**

## README TRACKING SYSTEM
**CRITICAL: Every job application folder MUST have a README.md file at the root level**

### README Requirements:
1. **Application URL at top** - Direct link to apply
2. **Change log** - Document all modifications and updates
3. **File inventory** - List all created materials with status
4. **Brand elements** - Company colors and visual identity used
5. **Key positioning** - Strategic messaging and unique selling points
6. **Next steps** - Clear action items and follow-up timeline

### Location Rule:
- README.md goes in **ROOT** of job folder (NOT in OLD subfolder)
- Example: `Jobs/1_Preparation_Stage/[Company]/README.md`
- Example: `Jobs/2_Applied/[Company]/README.md`

### Update Requirements:
- Update README with every change made to application materials
- Log date, time, and specific modifications
- Track application status progression through workflow stages
