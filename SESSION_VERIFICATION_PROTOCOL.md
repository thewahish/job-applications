# SESSION VERIFICATION PROTOCOL - MANDATORY STARTUP

## CRITICAL: NO RESUME WORK WITHOUT VERIFICATION

### MANDATORY SESSION STARTUP SEQUENCE

**STEP 1: KNOWLEDGE BASE VERIFICATION (REQUIRED)**
Before any resume/cover letter work, Claude MUST confirm:

```
VERIFICATION STATEMENT: "I have read ULTIMATE_RESUME_HELPER_MASTER_v2.md, OBAI_SUKAR_MASTER_PROFILE_2025.md, and CLAUDE.md corrections. I will use ONLY verified facts from these sources."
```

**STEP 2: FACT-CHECK PROTOCOL (EVERY CLAIM)**
For EVERY piece of information included:

1. **Source Verification**: "Where in the knowledge base is this documented?"
2. **Accuracy Check**: "Is this exactly as stated in verified sources?"
3. **Context Validation**: "Am I maintaining proper context (e.g., Karazah Channel for 301M+ views)?"
4. **Fabrication Test**: "Does this sound like something I might be making up?"

**STEP 3: ATS COMPLIANCE CHECK (EVERY RESUME)**
For ALL ATS resume files:

- [ ] NO emojis
- [ ] NO colored backgrounds
- [ ] NO borders or border-radius
- [ ] NO complex styling
- [ ] ONLY black text on white background
- [ ] Standard fonts only
- [ ] Simple formatting only
