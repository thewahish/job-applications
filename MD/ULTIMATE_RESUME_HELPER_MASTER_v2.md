### Project-Specific Accuracy Rules
**ÿßŸÑŸÖŸàŸÉÿ® ÿßŸÑÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ (Audio Director):**
- NEVER claim: 15+ team management, composed music, international voices
- ACCURATE: "Directed complete audio post-production", "Mixed orchestral score", "Supervised sound design team and contributed to sound effects creation"

**Spacetoon Experience:**
- NEVER claim: 12+ engineers, Logic Pro usage, specific team sizes
- ACCURATE: Built studios, custom DAW workflows, training programs, youngest department head

**Karazah Channel International Scope:**
- ACCURATE: "Managed international Karazah Channel production teams across Egypt, France, Germany, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Japan, USA, and UAE"

**Radio Al-Kul Crisis Broadcasting:**
- ACCURATE: "Engineered covert broadcasting infrastructure including mobile pirate radio transmitters, website streaming, and satellite uplinks while evading detection and risking lives to provide truth, resistance, and civilian safety warnings"

### Technical Skills (VERIFIED ONLY - NO FABRICATION)
**NEVER ADD WITHOUT CONFIRMATION:**
- Max/MSP, Pure Data, Python audio scripting
- Specific certifications not earned (Avid Certified, etc.)
- Team sizes, employee counts, specific technical protocols not mentioned
- Geographic counting ("4 continents", "3 continents") - unnecessary detail

**EMPHASIS APPROACH:**
- Use excellence language: "exceptional talent", "guru", "excellence" over breadth
- Focus on mastery in verified skills rather than listing everything
- Only claim specific technologies explicitly confirmed

### Foundation Skills Protection Protocol
1. When user asks to edit/remove foundational skills ‚Üí ALWAYS update master file as permanent rule
2. ONLY exception: If skill appears job-required ‚Üí Ask user first before including
3. ALWAYS reference this master file FIRST before creating any resume content
4. UPDATE master file immediately when user provides corrections

---

## üéØ Storytelling & Messaging

### Resilience Narrative (TIMELINE ACCURACY REQUIRED)
**CRITICAL: Maintain chronological accuracy to preserve credibility**

**CORRECT Timeline-Accurate Narrative:**
"Everybody has a story. Life throws unexpected paths. After building my IT and media career, I found myself in a conflict-zone building resilient broadcasting systems in 2012, and today I'm seeking a company that matches my ambition and brilliance forged through diverse challenges."

**NEVER USE:** "I started in a conflict-zone" - Falsely implies career began there  
**ALWAYS USE:** Timeline-accurate phrasing showing conflict zone as mid-career challenge (2012), not career start (2000)

### Tone Requirements
- **Professional yet human**
- **Confident yet humble**  
- **Never flattering or defensive**
- **Results-driven with specific metrics**
- **Company-specific without being generic**

## üî• CARDINAL RULE - NEVER FABRICATE

### The Most Important Rule (NEVER BREAK)
**NEVER MAKE UP STUFF - NO NEED TO IMPRESS WITH THINGS I DIDN'T DO**

- ‚ùå **Never invent**: Team sizes, employee counts, specific metrics not provided
- ‚ùå **Never add**: Technologies, tools, or skills not explicitly confirmed  
- ‚ùå **Never claim**: Awards not won, certifications not earned, roles not performed
- ‚ùå **Never exaggerate**: Scope, responsibility, or technical depth beyond truth

### If Something Seems Needed But Not Confirmed
1. **STOP** - Do not add it automatically
2. **ASK** - "This appears to be required for the job - should I include it?"
3. **DISCUSS** - We decide together how to handle job requirements vs. truth
4. **DOCUMENT** - Add agreed approach to this master file

### Truth-First Approach
- **Your actual achievements are impressive enough**
- **Authenticity > Fabrication always**
- **Better to be accurate than artificially impressive**
- **Hiring managers value honesty and can detect fabrication**

---

## üìù VERSION CONTROL & FILE MANAGEMENT

### Mandatory File Naming Convention
**ALL output files MUST include version control and dates:**
- Format: `companyname_documenttype_YYYY-MM-DD_vX.extension`
- Examples:
  - `meta_combined_2025-09-01_v1.html`
  - `meta_resume_only_2025-09-01_v2.pdf`
  - `meta_cover_only_2025-09-01_v3.html`

### Version Control Rules
1. **ALWAYS increment version number** when making changes to output files
2. **ALWAYS include current date** in filename 
3. **Track major changes** in version increments (v1 ‚Üí v2 for significant updates)
4. **Keep chronological order** visible in file names

### File Backup Protocol (NEVER DELETE - BACKUP TO OLD FOLDER)
**WHAT GETS MOVED TO OLD FOLDER:**
- ‚úÖ Previous HTML versions (.html)
- ‚úÖ Previous PDF versions (.pdf) 
- ‚úÖ Previous Word documents (.docx)
- ‚úÖ Previous output versions of same document type
- ‚úÖ JavaScript files (html_to_pdf.js, conversion scripts, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies (node_modules, package.json, package-lock.json, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Batch/conversion files (.bat, .cmd, etc.)
- ‚úÖ All programming/development files

**WHAT STAYS IN MAIN FOLDER:**
- ‚úÖ Latest agreed-upon versions (renamed without version numbers) - ONLY 4 files
- ‚úÖ Master .md files (analysis_report.md, skills_gap_analysis.md, etc.) - if any
- ‚úÖ Asset folders and logos - if needed for future updates

### Backup & Organization Process
1. **Generate new version** with proper naming
2. **Test and confirm completion** of job application files
3. **CREATE OLD folder** if not exists
4. **ASK USER**: "Final version confirmed. Should I move previous versions to OLD folder: [list old files]?"
5. **MOVE old files** to OLD folder (keeping full version names)
6. **COPY final version** to OLD folder with version name intact
7. **RENAME final version** in main folder to clean names:
   - `companyname_resume_only.pdf` (no date/version)
   - `companyname_cover_only.pdf` (no date/version)
   - `companyname_combined.pdf` (no date/version)
   - `companyname_cover_interactive.html` (artistic version)

### Standard 4-File Structure (Post-Cleanup)
**Main Folder (Clean Names):**
- `companyname_resume_only.pdf` - ATS-friendly resume
- `companyname_cover_only.pdf` - Professional cover letter  
- `companyname_combined.pdf` - Cover + resume combined
- `companyname_cover_interactive.html` - Artistic social media style

**OLD Folder (Version History):**
