## üîç MANUAL REVIEW PROCESS

1. **Read Aloud Test**: Does it sound like Obai talking?
2. **Story Check**: Are personal experiences driving the narrative?
3. **Pattern Scan**: Any phrases from the red flag list?
4. **Emotion Check**: Does it have heart, not just competence?
5. **Uniqueness Test**: Could only Obai write this sentence?

## üìù REVISION PROMPTS

If you find AI patterns, ask:
- How would Obai actually say this?
- What's the real story behind this claim?
- Can I replace this transition with a direct statement?
- Does this sentence have Obai's personality?

## üéØ GOAL
Every sentence should be unmistakably Obai - confident, authentic, story-driven, and impossible for anyone else to write.
